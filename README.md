# Price Comparator - Market (Java Backend)

This backend project it allows users to compare product prices across major Romanian supermarkets (Lidl, Kaufland, Profi) based on real-world CSV data.

---

## Project Structure

- `TestController.java`: REST controller exposing all required endpoints
- `CsvLoaderService.java`: Service class that reads and parses CSV product/discount data
- `Product.java` / `Discount.java`: Domain models
- `BasketRequest.java`: Payload model for daily basket optimization
- `PriceAlertRequest.java`: Payload model for custom price alerts
- `LocalDateConverter.java`: Converts date strings to `LocalDate`
- `resources/products/`: Sample product CSVs (e.g., `lidl_2025-05-08.csv`)
- `resources/discounts/`: Sample discount CSVs (e.g., `profi_discounts_2025-05-08.csv`)

---

## Assumptions

- The application does not use a database; it processes CSV files on request.
- Only `.csv` files are supported.
- Matching is done by `productName` (case-insensitive) for simplicity.
